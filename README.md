first i created a function that receives the array of strings as argument,
after which the objects are being destructured, and the minlength i.e the minimum length of each of the string are being calculated,

the for loop is now use to itreate over each of the string and compair it with the string of the second element, if the match, then that particular string is them added to the commonPrefix string decleard at the top .
